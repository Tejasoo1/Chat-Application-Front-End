/* 
~ Setting up the vite:-

  1] npm i --> install all the npm packages 

  2] Use the snippet rfc.

  3] npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev

  4] Add these two lines of code in rules: {...} of .eslintrc.cjs file, to show yellow underline instead of red:
     'no-unused-vars': 'warn',
     'react/prop-types': 'off', 

^ Parent Route Context:
  When you define an 'index' route, it is always nested inside a 'parent' route. In the case of the 
  below code, the parent route is the base route (/).
    
^ Default Route Matching:
  1] When the 'parent' route is matched, and no other child routes are matched, the 'index' route is the one 
     that gets matched by default.

  2] The 'index' route (<Route index element={<Navbar />} />) matches the 'base' URL by default because 
     it is designed to match when the 'parent' route (in this case, the root route '/') is matched and
     no other 'child' routes are matched.
  
  3] The element={<Navbar />} specifies that the 'Navbar' component should be rendered for this route.

~ Installing Chakra UI:-

1] it is a component library.
2] npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
